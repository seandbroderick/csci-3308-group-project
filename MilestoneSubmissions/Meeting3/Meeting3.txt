Meeting Content:
The three of us had a meeting to work on integrating pieces of the project that have been 
worked on by other members, and making sure everything worked and loaded properly across different 
machines. We managed to successfully complete our task, fixing the authentication logic, as well 
as the way that handlebars were being initialized in our program. While before the meeting we were 
unable to load any pages, by the end we had a fully functioning login and register page that connects 
with our database. We discussed future plans for this week, including the creation of our map home page,
and updating the UI across all pages. Sean will also begin work on displaying the map, which will be
taken over by Ethan to implement parking spot locations once complete.
